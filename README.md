# pml-image-classification

Application and performance comparison of several machine learning algorithms for image classification on the fashion MNIST dataset. 
The algorithms analyzed are:

- Feed Forward Neural Networks
- Bayesian Neural Networks
- Gaussian Processes
- Bayesian Logistic Regression + Stochastic Variational Inference
- Logistic regression
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

Moreover, the performance of the deterministic and bayesian neaural network was also tested against adversarial attacks.

Frameworks:
- Pyro
- PyTorch
